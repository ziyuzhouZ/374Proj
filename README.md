This is an investigation regarding the multitask learning model on demo-based product recommendation

Since the original dataset is too large. I could not upload it here.
The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkalk/large-retail-data-set-for-eda

After download the dataset, you can use separate_data.py to get three csv file of product_info, customer_info and linkning _table
Then use clean_data.py to clear out all the noises and interfereing data

Before you get started to train the model, the data_structure.sql shows how I manage the data. 

You can adjust the head() in load_data_sample.py to get different sizes of your sample.

With your db file generated by load_data_sample.py is set, you can run the models:

1. multi_task_model.py: the major model
2. STM(single task learning model): help you do the comparsion
3. baseline.py: the baseline model help you know the data itself and evaluate your MLT.

I have run the data of sample size from 1000 to 150000. For futher size, the algorithm or the CPU need to be improved.

You can get your result by modifing the result_plot.py.

My result are shown as the metrics_vs_sample_size.png
