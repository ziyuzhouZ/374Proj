This is an investigation regarding the multitask learning model on demo-based product recommendation

Since the original dataset is too large. I could not upload it here.
But I will try to use the url link to import the data later so anyone accesses the files could load and import the data to build up a retail.db file.

For the multitask model, I haven't started the comparsion of it with other single task model. It is right now a rough model based on NN.
